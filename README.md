## CI4kRPC (Time Based DiscordRPC written in Java)

###### Caught in 4k Rich Presence or CI4kRPC is a discord development project I started in desperation to stop people from dming me while I was at work. This fully configurable DiscordRPC automatically updates to a configured text and images based on the day of the week as well as a fraction of minutes. I hope this RPC will make your life easier in some way as well! This project is also just experience on the side so I can mentally process unix time faster.
